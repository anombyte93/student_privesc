## 🔄 How to Update (Sync) Your Fork

This makes sure you always have the most up-to-date version of the worksheets.

1. Navigate to the main repository:  
   👉 [anombyte93/student_privesc](https://github.com/anombyte93/student_privesc)

2. On the right, you will see the **Fork** button (with a number next to it, e.g., 13 forks).

3. Click the dropdown arrow on **Fork** and select **“Existing fork”**.  
   - This is your fork of my repo (what you are working on).  
   - If this option is not available, click the **Fork** button and fork the repo again to begin work!

4. If you already have a fork, click on it.  
   - You should see a banner at the top saying something like:  
     *“This branch is 2 commits ahead of, 1 commit behind anombyte93/student_privesc:main.”*

5. Click the **“Sync Fork”** button and accept the changes.  
   - If prompted, **discard any commits** it says to.

6. Done ✅ — your fork now has the newest worksheets!
